Module Assignments
------------------

For each module, students are to complete a major assignment. Staff from the MIT Writing and Communications Center introduce each assignment with a tutorial session, and offer personalized help for the students. In the following table, examples of student work are presented courtesy of the student authors and used with permission.

Journal Club
------------

The following lists are provided as a guideline for the types of papers that might be relevant for your presentation. You are not limited to these primary research articles. The list is provided simply to give you an idea of the kinds of subjects that could make suitable presentations for the class. Search [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/) yourself to find articles of interest to you. Once you have decided on a paper for your presentation, please email the instructors. As you prepare your talk be sure to follow our [guidelines for oral presentations]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/guide_oral_prese-htm).
